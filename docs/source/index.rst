Welcome the Hanze Master eQTL workshop
===================================

In this workshop we will be linking genetic variants to gene expression via so-called eQTL mapping. There are some `slides <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1eU1RI9GjH9IQBGPWFMGW_IBcvKado4rH>`_ on the concepts of QTL mapping, before you can get started on the actual analysis. There should also be a mirror of the relevant files on BlackBoard (as a zip).

First let us set up our environment to work in :doc:`setup`
