Questions and assignments
------------

You can find a completed python notebook here: https://github.com/royoelen/hanze-python-qtl-workshop/blob/main/resources/hanze_qtl_workshop.ipynb

Now that you have done some eQTL mapping and looked at some effects in plots, try to do these assignments and answer these questions

1.  Check the results files that are in the Google Drive. Did they find any results for chromosome 22, that you did not find?

2.  This tool is unfortunately not the most efficient. This might be an issue specifically when you are doing a trans-mapping. Can you think of a reason why?

3.	Try to think of ways to optimize here.

4.	For now it seems we are doing separate runs of each chromosome of SNPs, against each chromosome of genes. This however presents us with one problem, can you think of the issue?

5.	There is also data specifically for chromosome 6, try to run this pipeline again, but with (a subset of) chromosome 6

6.  How do your results compare to what was found before?

7.  This is not a very efficient tool, can you find other QTL mapping tools?
