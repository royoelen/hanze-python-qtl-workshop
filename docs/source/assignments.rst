Questions and assignments
------------

Now that you have done some eQTL mapping and looked at some effects in plots, try to do these assignments and answer these questions

1.  Check one of the eQTLs of the unconfined results, that was significant before multiple testing correction, by plotting it. Would you say this is a real effect?

2.  This tool is unfortunately not the most efficient. This might be an issue specifically when you are doing a trans-mapping. Can you think of a reason why?

3.	Try to think of ways to optimize here.

4.	One of the ways to optimize, would be to do separate runs of each chromosome of SNPs, against each chromosome of genes. This however presents us with one problem, can you think of the issue?

5.	Implement in Python a way to get the expression and genotype data for the first chromosome.

6.  run the eQTL mapping tool again, using just the chromosome 1 inputs you generated.


When you feel like you have made an honest effort, you can check the code here: https://github.com/royoelen/hanze-python-qtl-workshop/blob/main/resources/hanze_master_eqtl_workshop_2023.ipynb
